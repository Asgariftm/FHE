Here we steps I have taken:
1. Research about how I should use this kind of data as a input to CNN
2. Converting all images from DICOM foramt to MLDB format which is more convenient for CNN
3. Designing a CNN for the problem
4. Using the proposed CNN to segment LV erea 

In the next step I should use a method to calculate EF.

The code for thses steps are pushed.
